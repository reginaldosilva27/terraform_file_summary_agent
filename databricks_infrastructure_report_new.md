### Summary:
This report provides a comprehensive overview of the Databricks infrastructure as defined in the Terraform files. The identified resources include clusters, jobs, SQL endpoint configurations, user permissions, catalogs, and tables, delivering valuable insights into the Databricks workspace setup and configurations.

----------

### Comprehensive Assessment Report on Databricks Infrastructure

#### 1. **Identified Non-Standard Configurations:**
- **Cluster Autotermination Setting:** Two clusters (`cl_noisolation` and `cl_unitycatalog`) have an autotermination setting of `0`, meaning they will run indefinitely and not automatically terminate during idle periods, which can lead to unnecessary costs.
- **Job Scheduling:** Several jobs lack configured alerts, potentially resulting in undetected failures or issues. Notably, many jobs are set for a specific user rather than using a shared owner, which can complicate management and maintenance.

#### 2. **Quantities of Each Resource Type:**
- **Total Clusters:** 3
- **Total Jobs:** 11
- **Total SQL Endpoints:** 2
- **Total Users:** 4
- **Total Catalogs:** 12
- **Total Tables:** 43

#### 3. **Detection of Oversized Clusters / Inefficient Autoscaling Configurations:**
- **Cluster `Reginaldo Silva's Cluster-Share`:** Configured to scale between 10 and 120 workers, which is likely oversized for most use cases. This may lead to excessive resource consumption and costs. Recommend evaluating the job workloads to determine optimal minimum and maximum worker settings.

#### 4. **External Libraries Usage:**
- No explicit information on external libraries was provided in the Terraform configuration. Recommend tracking the usage of external libraries to ensure you are using only necessary packages, as unnecessary libraries can increase the complexity and potential security vulnerabilities.

#### 5. **Clusters Not Enabled with Unity Catalog:**
- The `cl_noisolation` and `cl_unitycatalog` clusters are not integrated with Unity Catalog, which would provide enhanced governance and security features. Recommend evaluating the use of Unity Catalog for improved data management and security.

#### 6. **Databricks Runtime Versions Older than 14.3:**
- **Cluster `cl_unitycatalog`:** Running on Spark Version 13.2.x-scala2.12, which is older than the recommended version (14.3). Recommend upgrading to at least version 14.3 or later for better performance, security, and feature set.

#### 7. **Jobs Assigned to Individual Owners:**
- Multiple jobs (e.g., `Job - IfCondition`, `Processa Medalhão`) are assigned to the specific user `Reginaldo Silva`, making management cumbersome. Recommend refactoring job ownership to be more centralized and shared by roles rather than individual users.

#### 8. **Jobs Lacking Configured Alerts:**
- Jobs such as `Job Event based` and several others do not have failure alerts configured. Implementing notification mechanisms for job failures is critical for proactive monitoring and quick resolution.

#### 9. **High-Access or Security Concerns:**
- Users `Reginaldo Hotmail (Admin)` and `Reginaldo Admin` have significant permissions, notably `Allow Instance Pool Create` and `Allow Cluster Create`. Recommend conducting a review of permissions and ensuring they follow the principle of least privilege to minimize security risks.

#### 10. **SQL Compute Resources Over-Provisioned:**
- Both SQL endpoints (`PROWarehouse` and `WarehouseServerless`) are configured with `2X-Small` clusters, but the workload characteristics should be analyzed to ensure sufficient but not excessive resources are provisioned. Recommend resizing based on actual usage metrics.

#### 11. **Workspace Administrators and Their Activities:**
- Review and limit the number of workspace administrators as having multiple admins with broad permissions can lead to security vulnerabilities. Strengthen accountability by keeping admin roles limited.

#### 12. **Additional Best Practices Recommendations:**
- **Implement Monitoring & Alerts:** Set up performance dashboards and alerts to monitor cluster performance, job execution times, and resource usage.
- **Unity Catalog Integration:** Explore integrating Unity Catalog for enhanced data governance features and fine-grained access control.
- **Cluster Cost Management:** Regularly review cluster utilization and adjust configurations to avoid wasteful spending. Consider utilizing spot instances where applicable.
- **Documentation and Training:** Ensure that all users are familiar with best practices for job creation, data access, and security protocols.
- **Backup and Recovery Procedures:** Establish a comprehensive backup strategy for critical data and workloads to prevent data loss.

This report serves as the foundation for optimizing your Databricks environment, ensuring you can achieve both enhanced performance and strengthened security. Recommendations should be prioritized based on immediate impact and feasibility.
