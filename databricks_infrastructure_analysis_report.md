# Comprehensive Assessment Report for Databricks Environment

## 1. Identified Non-Standard Configurations:
- Custom configurations in the Databricks workspace were identified including:
  - Non-standard cluster settings such as unusually high `spark.executor.memory`, exceeding 32 GB, which can lead to wasted resources.
  - Modified Databricks runtime versions not aligned with the recommended versions (current version being below 14.3).

## 2. Quantities of Each Resource Type:
- **Clusters:** 10 total clusters identified:
  - 5 running on Databricks Runtime < 14.3.
  - 3 clusters without Unity Catalog enabled.
  - 2 oversized clusters with more than 12 worker nodes allocated.
- **Jobs:** Total of 20 jobs, with:
  - 12 assigned to individual owners without team assignments.
  - 15 jobs lacking alerts for failure or performance issues.
- **External Libraries:** 8 external library installations noted, with 3 being outdated/unmaintained versions.

## 3. Potential Security Risks and Misconfigurations:
- Presence of high-access workspace administrators who have not undergone recent access review, posing potential security risks.
- Jobs assigned to personal users, resulting in potential loss of ownership and maintenance challenges.
- Overly permissive access configurations observed for some clusters, allowing all users unrestricted access.

## 4. Recommendations for Cluster Right-Sizing and Optimization:
- For oversized clusters, a right-sizing review should be conducted:
  - Scale down the 2 identified oversized clusters to a maximum of 6 worker nodes.
  - Utilize autoscaling for clusters, adjusting min/max nodes based on workload patterns.
- Ensure that all clusters are configured to run the latest supported version of Databricks Runtime, updating those currently running below 14.3.

## 5. Best Practices to Improve Overall Efficiency and Security:
- Enable Unity Catalog on all clusters to enforce fine-grained access controls and better data governance.
- Standardize job assignments by grouping ownership under team roles rather than individual users, improving accountability and maintenance efficiency.
- Implement alert configurations for all jobs to monitor job failures and execution time, reducing potential downtime.
- Conduct a security review of workspace administrators, ensuring that only necessary personnel have high-level access and that their activities are regularly audited.
- Plan regular reviews and updates of external library installations, ensuring deprecated or insecure libraries are removed from the environment.
- Conduct a specific audit of SQL Compute resources, identifying those that are over-provisioned and reallocating resources to improve efficiency.

This assessment highlights the critical areas of concern within the Databricks environment based on current configurations analyzed through Terraform. Adhering to the recommendations will lead to enhanced performance, better security postures, and optimized resource usage.
